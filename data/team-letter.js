	steps: [
		'Print out 10 copies of the ‘Dear Team’ letter template. To aid facilitation ­ lay out the the room with the appropriate ‘Dear team’ letter template for your project stage. Allow one template per person facedown in the middle of the table to aid surprise.',
		'Each person must write a letter to their future team. The letter is designed to help each of the team members be open and honest about themselves. To share information about their lives and build a bond with the other team members. They will have 20 minutes to write their letters.(if the team struggles with the task an extra 10 minutes can be given). Let the team know at the end of the 20 minutes they will be asked to read their letters aloud to the room.',
		'Ask the team to turn over the templates and start reading the template. Sharing and being open may be outside of some team members comfort zones. Prompts have been provided at the bottom of the template ­however be prepared to answer questions and ensure everyone knows this is a safe space.',
		'After 20 minutes stop the participants and ask them to stand in a circle ready to share their letter with the rest of the team.',
		'Ask everyone in turn to read their letter aloud. After they have finished ­ encourage the group to ask questions but be careful to ensure this doesn’t turn into a debate. It’s important for everyone to know their voice is heard and there will be no judgement.',
		'To wrap up the exercise have a short round of applause and thank everyone for being so open. We would suggest having a team bonding exercise or social activity later in the day if possible so the team can build upon the new understanding of each other.',
